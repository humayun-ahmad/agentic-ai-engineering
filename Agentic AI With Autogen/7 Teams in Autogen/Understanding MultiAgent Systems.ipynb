      "### The Pokémon: Riolu\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background:** This Riolu was hatched from an egg given to Leo by his parents, who hoped it would help their timid son grow more confident. From the moment it hatched, Riolu sensed Leo’s gentle nature and his underlying anxiety. It never saw Leo’s fear as a weakness, but as something precious that needed protecting. It has spent its short life watching Leo, learning his habits, and feeling a powerful, instinctual bond that goes beyond typical training.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Motivation:** Riolu's motivation is one of pure, unwavering loyalty. It lives to be the courage that Leo sometimes lacks. The encounter with the Mightyena was a pivotal moment—the first time its protective instinct physically manifested as a new power (Force Palm). Its journey is not for badges or glory, but to become strong enough to ensure that Leo is never harmed and can continue his own journey, safe under its watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "### The Villain: The Mightyena\n",
      "\n",
      "**Background:** This Mightyena was not born wild. It was the lead Pokémon of a ruthless trainer who valued only power. After losing a critical battle, Mightyena was cruelly abandoned and left for dead near this cave. The snarling aggression is a mask for deep-seated trauma and a bitter sense of betrayal. It has survived alone, its loyalty shattered, and now views all trainers and their partners with scorn and hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Motivation:** The Mightyena is driven by territorial rage and resentment. It blocks the cave entrance not just to guard its lair, but to actively challenge the bond between trainers and Pokémon that it once cherished and lost. Seeing Leo’s fear and Riolu’s bravery enrages it; the scene is a painful reminder of its own past. Its goal is to prove that such bonds are fragile and that true strength lies in solitary, bitter survival. It wants to break them to validate its own tragic existence.\n",
      "ending_writer : As the defeated Mightyena fled, Leo’s trembling stopped. A cold, appraising smile crept across his face. \"Good,\" he whispered, his voice suddenly hard as steel. \"You finally unlocked your power.\"\n",
